## Reflections and Comments
+ Tough assignment; was not able to get it to work due to an issue with the random number generator. After talking to two differnt TAs (and conflicting feedback, figured out what I will need to do to refactor the code.). That said, per feedback from my 201 TA (Skyler), I will do this later since I have already received a grade on this and will focus energy and time on lab 07.
+ The DOM is definitely a challenge as it is a complex concept - when combined with objects and how it all fits together. But this is also the exciting part as I feel this is a fundamental aspect of JS that is helping me how things work (e.g. methods, functions, etc.).  Each lab is very exciting, even if tough; just wish I can devote more time to it.
+ Iteratively updated the project using branching; very cool.
